## Wine qualiy oredict model 

I recently finished a deep learning course in courseera and I tried to create a prediction model with what I learned. I used a wine quality dtataset and I tried keras and scikit learn to make a prediction deep learnig model.

I am really new to all of this stuff and if there is aything wrong with my model I will be more than happy to let me know.
